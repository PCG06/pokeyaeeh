# Pokémon YAEEH

## What does YAEEH mean?

YAEEH means Yet Another Emerald Enhancement Hack.

It's a joke on the hundreds of Emerald enhancement hacks (no offence) out there, but YAEEH isn't quite the Emerald enhancement hack you might have thought!

## Overview

YAEEH takes place in Hoenn. You play as Brendan or May, as usual and roam through the region. But something is different. The Gym Leaders seemed different, Wally seemed different, what is this? THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED?! BY WHO?! By some weird people, yes. Beat them all and face the Elite Four and Champion to prove the world you're the very best, like no one ever was!

There's some coarse language in the game, so if you're looking for a good experience, this hack is not for you! But if you like weird dialogue, you might find it interesting.

## pokeemerald-expansion
- This game wouldn't have been made without the amazing pokeemerald-expansion!
- All the features like Pokémon, abilities, moves, items, battle engine, gimmicks and forms, and more were made by the talented folks over at RHH!
- YAEEH is based off RHH's pokeemerald-expansion v1.6.2.
