# Pokémon YAEEH

## What does YAEEH mean?

YAEEH literally means Yet Another Emerald Enhancement Hack.

It's a joke on the hundreds of Emerald enhancement hacks, but YAEEH isn't quite the Emerald enhancement hack you might have thought!

## Overview

YAEEH takes place in Hoenn. Wow, who would've thought an Emerald hack not taking place in Hoenn?! You play as Brendan or May, as usual and roam through the region. But something is different. The Gym Leaders seemed different, Wally seemed different, what is this? THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED?! BY WHO?! By some people, yes. Your real dad has also come back with the milk to test you and see if you are worth the child suppport!
